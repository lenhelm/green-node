# GreenNode

GreenNode helps to analyze suppy chain networks for the most CO2 efficient production process.

Supply chains consist of resources, suppliers, customers, logistic companies and a varity of different transportation vessels. To identify the less CO2 consuming production process can be a daunting task considering the complexity of such networks. Graphs are the most natural representation for networks and smart minds found many algorithms that help to answer different questions
